Project from Hyperskill.org -
It's tic-tac-toe and it also includes an AI with varying difficulty.

This is my second project :)

I know Main.java is a mess and that I can literally just use switch or something instead of making it extra long but whatever, after days of debugging the Hard AI I just want to revel in the victory. ðŸ¤
